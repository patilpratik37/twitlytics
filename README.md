# Twitlytics
Twitlytics is a data mining project that leverages the Twitter API (now outdated) to extract and analyze tweets. The project focuses on sentiment analysis of Twitter data using the XGBoost algorithm, achieving an accuracy rate of 86%.

## Features

- **Data Mining**: Utilizes the Twitter API to collect tweets on specific topics or keywords.
- **Text Pre-processing**: Implements regular expression techniques for text pre-processing to clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Applies the XGBoost algorithm for sentiment analysis, achieving an accuracy rate of 86%. This process involves classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on their content.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Update the configuration file with your Twitter API credentials.
4. Run the script to collect tweets and perform sentiment analysis.

Key Components:
- **Twitter API Integration**: Allows the retrieval of real-time Twitter data for analysis.
- **Regular Expression**: Facilitates text pre-processing to remove noise and standardize text data.
- **XGBoost Algorithm**: Performs sentiment analysis with high accuracy, enabling effective classification of tweet sentiments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- XGBoost library
- Twitter Developer account (for API access)

## Results:
The Twitlytics project achieves an 86% accuracy rate in sentiment analysis, providing valuable insights into the sentiment trends of Twitter users regarding specific topics or keywords.

## Usage:
- Obtain Twitter API access credentials.
- Clone the repository and configure the API credentials.
- Run the project to mine Twitter data, preprocess text, and perform sentiment analysis.

## Future Improvements:
- Migration to Updated APIs: Consider migrating to updated Twitter APIs for continued data access and analysis.
- Enhanced Text Pre-processing: Implement advanced text pre-processing techniques to further improve data quality and analysis accuracy.
- Integration of Additional Algorithms: Explore the integration of additional machine learning algorithms for comparative analysis and enhanced performance.
